TensorFlow implementation for "Guided Optical Flow Learning". 
You can refer to paper for more details at [Openreview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1kggAGgb&noteId=S1kggAGgb) or [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02295).

The code is ready to run, but the accuracy is a little lower than both [Caffe](https://github.com/bryanyzhu/GuidedNet) and Pytorch implementation. 

Proceed if you really want to use TensorFlow.
